# Client-Project-2
The website provides comprehensive access to cross country meet information. Designed for easy navigation, the platform allows users to search and explore results from various meets. Key features include detailed athlete results, team results, overall comments and photo gallery.

This site serves as a central resource for tracking performances, comparing team standings, and reviewing insights from each meet, making it an essential tool for those involved in the sport.

The Python script processes cross-country meet data from a CSV file and generates an HTML page displaying key information such as Athlete Results, Team Results, Overall Comments, and Photo Gallery. The script extracts relevant data and organizes it into sections for easy viewing.

To run the script, place the CSV file at the specified path. Run the script using Python, and it will generate an HTML file that can be opened in any web browser.
